No.,Keyword,question,Answer,"Notes, references",Last updated date etc.
1-001,What is export control?,What should we do with export control?,"""Export control"" within Renesas Electronics means complying with the following legal regulations: ""list regulations"" and ""catch-all regulations"" stipulated in the Foreign Exchange Act + ""EAR regulations"" stipulated in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.・The purpose of laws and regulations is to maintain international peace and security, and to prohibit the export of weapons, related materials and equipment that contribute to the design and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, general-purpose items related to conventional weapons, and related technologies. It regulates provision. - ""Export control"" in a broad sense includes compliance with the ""Specified Export Declaration System"" stipulated in the ""Customs Law"" and ""Customs Tariff Law,"" but here we will limit it to ""export control for security reasons.""",,
1-002,Implementation of export control procedures,Would it be possible for the export control department to handle all export control procedures?,"·you can't. At the request of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, we are being told to ``conduct a double check by an independent department within the company.'' For this reason, within Renesas, the import department conducts double checks. (This is why the import control department is sometimes called the ""secondary examination department."") For example, the quality assurance department should not carry out design and manufacturing, and the accounting auditor should prepare financial statements. Just as they do not do so, the import control department does not carry out any formalities. Just check. In the first place, it is impossible to determine whether or not a product is applicable unless one is thoroughly familiar with the specifications and specs of the product and technology, so we have adopted a system in which the design and technology departments make the initial determination.・In addition, at the time of the secondary examination of the classification, the import control department asks, ``Will you be satisfied with this classification result when the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry conducts the on-site inspection?'' We keep this in mind when checking whether we will lose if we have to dispute the results in court. In addition, during the secondary examination of the transaction examination (former export control form), (1) depending on the combination of the relevant item number and destination country, whether an individual license application is required or whether it is possible to export with a special general comprehensive export license. (2) Check that the recipient (company or individual) is not on a blacklist; (3) Check that there are no concerns about the use of the information.",,Changed on 2012.6.14
1-003,“Applicable” to list regulations,Aren't there any specifications for Renesas products that fall under list regulations?,"·there is. Please be aware that there are two types of cases: ``When the Renesas product itself is ``applicable'''' and ``When the technology used to design, manufacture, and use Renesas products is ``applicable''.'' (1) When the Renesas product itself is ``applicable'', the most common case is when it has an encryption function. The second most common case is a custom product (a product whose circuit was designed by the customer), and the customer should have determined whether the product is compliant or not, but because the customer did not do so, Renesas sent Form 6-1-9 ( It is judged as ""Applicable"" by the parameter sheet of Unknown Custom). Some of the standard products whose specifications are determined by Renesas are determined to be ""applicable"" because the upper limit of the rated operating temperature range exceeds the regulation value of 125°C when judged using Form ""6-1-1"" (general-purpose microcontrollers). There are some things to judge. (2) An example of ""if the technology used to design, manufacture, and use Renesas products is 'applicable'"" is ""any specification where the propagation delay time of the basic gate (NAND gate, etc.) exceeds the regulation value (less than 0.02 nanoseconds)"" When providing technology necessary to design and manufacture digital integrated circuits to overseas affiliates, etc., or when entrusting the design and manufacture of microcomputer products to overseas affiliates, etc. If the value exceeds the value, etc.",,"Changed on September 15, 2014"

2-140,Determination of model name with customer ROM code written,"Although the model name of the blank product has an encryption function, it has been determined that it does not fall under Section 9 (7) of Appended Table 1 of the Export Ordinance due to the commercially available encryption exemption. I would like to use EXAM to determine whether a model name with a customer ROM code written in it falls under the sheet form ROM.Can it be determined that it does not fall under Section 9(7) of Appended Table 1 of the Export Order by applying the commercially available code exemption?","Basically, models with customer ROM code written are limited to customers and are not commercially available in the general market, so the commercial code exemption cannot be applied. Since blank products originally have cryptographic functions that fall under cryptographic function regulations, when determining whether or not a model name with a customer ROM code written is applicable, it must comply with Section 9 (7) of Appended Table 1 of the Export Ordinance. It will be judged as “applicable”. If a customer requests that commercially available encryption exclusion be applied to a model name with customer ROM code already written, the customer should make the determination themselves. (*Since we do not sell ROM code products (model names with customer ROM code written) to an unspecified number of people, we do not change our judgment results.)",,Added 2022.6.30

Regarding the ``wafers/chips'' that we provide as components, we do not individually determine whether they are applicable or not, but instead use the information on the completed product's eligibility determination as is. The link between finished products and parts is based on the linking information between ""pre-process"" and ""post-process"" in the production standard information.・In addition, in the RM method, individual components to be exported are not determined to be applicable, so for components that are linked to multiple finished products (especially multi-chip products), even one completed product cannot be determined to be applicable.

(Select the format ""FREE"" only for cargoes for which there is no parameter sheet format to be used for determination, such as evaluation boards.) (2) Title No. 85 in the old EL eligibility determination system. -15572, the model name ""μPC6772"" was determined using the format ""6-9"" (currently ""6-1-9"": unknown custom integrated circuit), but Renesas prefers to use the format ""6-1-9"" (currently ""6-1-9"": unknown custom integrated circuit).
